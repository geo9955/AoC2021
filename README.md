## Getting Started

This is my repository for Advent of Code 2021. Better late than never!

## Folder Structure

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
    - `DayX`: the folder containing the solution for AoC Day number X
## Running the solutions
Each solution is run in an App.java file located in `src`, which is not included in the repo because it would change with every single Day I finish and test. Just import the necessary Day and call `part1()` or `part2()` as necessary.
